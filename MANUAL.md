# Bapirlo OS — the manual

Everything on this laptop, in plain English: what it is, how to open it, how it works and how to switch it off.
Open this any time from the Start menu → **Bapirlo OS Guide** (Ctrl+F searches it).
The one-page **Emergency** sheet is a tab in the same window, and a PDF of it is in `~/bapirlo-os/EMERGENCY.pdf` for your phone.

> **The three things that save you most often**
>
> 1. **Bapirlo Doctor** (Start menu) tells you what is wrong. It changes nothing.
> 2. A **Timeshift snapshot** is taken before every system update, so a bad update can be rolled back.
> 3. If the desktop freezes, press [[Ctrl+Alt+F3]]. See [Troubleshooting](#e-troubleshooting).

Words used below: **Super** is the Windows key. The **Start menu** is ArcMenu (tap Super). The **Control Centre** is the
panel at the top right (click the Wi-Fi/battery capsule, or press [[Super+S]]). **Launchpad** is the full-screen app grid ([[Super+G]]).
Commands in `code` go in a terminal (Alacritty, or the drop-down one on [[Super+Enter]]).

## c) How each Bapirlo OS feature works — and how to turn it off

Every Bapirlo change was made by a script in `~/bapirlo-os`. Each one made a backup in `~/theme-backups` first, and each can undo itself
with `bash ~/bapirlo-os/<script>.sh restore`. For an extension the quick off switch is `gnome-extensions disable <name>`
(or the Extensions app). To put it back, use `enable`.

### Look & boot

- **Boot splash and menu.** The GRUB theme and the Plymouth "awakening" splash are themed. *Off:* `sudo bash ~/bapirlo-os/restore-boot-v2.sh`.
  (The Limine/GRUB boot setup itself was never changed.)
- **Login and lock screen.** This is the web-greeter "Bapirlo" theme. Because GNOME's own lock needs GDM, locking goes through the same screen:
  `bapirlo-lockd` locks on [[Super+L]], after 10 minutes idle and before suspend. *Back to the plain login screen:* `sudo bapirlo-greeter-revert`.
- **Theme everywhere.** GTK3, GTK4, Qt (Kvantum) and the shell all use one palette: ink black, crimson, ember, sakura and paper. *Undo:* `bash ~/bapirlo-os/410-toolkits.sh restore`, `bash ~/bapirlo-os/60-desktop-v2.sh restore`.
- **Day/night wallpaper.** The wallpaper switches between a bright day grade and a dark night grade at sunrise and sunset, and Night Light follows the same times.
  *Off:* `systemctl --user disable --now bapirlo-daycycle.timer`.
- **Wallpaper accent.** The second accent colour (pink) follows the wallpaper, while black and crimson never change. *Off:* `systemctl --user disable --now bapirlo-autotheme.service`.
- **Theme Studio.** Pick a wallpaper (or drop one into `~/Pictures/Theme Studio` and press *Preview* on the
  notification). It reads the colours with matugen (the same code as the wallpaper accent), builds a palette in the
  Kuro shape — same dark base, same contrast — and checks every text/background pair against WCAG AA before you
  apply. *Apply* re-themes the shell, top bar, dock, ArcMenu, Control Centre, Island, media widget, notifications,
  GTK 3/4 apps, Qt (Kvantum), terminals, fastfetch, the lock & login screen, and VS Code / Chrome / Spotify / Discord
  themes when those apps are installed; the screen cross-fades, no logout. Every applied theme is saved; **Original
  Bapirlo OS** puts back the exact files and settings you had. *Also apply to login & boot* (password) recolours the
  boot splash and rebuilds the boot images, with a backup and automatic roll-back.
  How it stays safe: the original themes are never edited; Studio writes recoloured copies (`Bapirlo-Studio-A/B`) and
  switches names. *Off:* apply Original, then `bash ~/bapirlo-os/studio/install.sh restore`.
- **Sounds.** The Bapirlo sound theme plays on log-in, notifications and so on. *Off:* Settings → Sound → Alert sound, or `gnome-extensions disable bapirlo-sounds@bapirlo-os`.

### Top bar, dock & menus

- **Top bar (Bapirlo Bar).** Bapirlo Bar groups everything into capsules. Red appears only for states that need you: recording, low battery, Do Not Disturb, Caffeine.
  The bar hides over fullscreen apps; push the mouse to the top edge to bring it back. *Off:* `gnome-extensions disable bapirlo-bar@bapirlo-os`.
- **Logo menu.** Clicking the B logo opens the Mac-style menu. The Start menu (ArcMenu) still opens with [[Super]]. *Off:* disable `logomenu@aryan_k`,
  then `gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.arcmenu menu-button-appearance Icon` to bring ArcMenu's logo back.
- **Control Centre.** It replaces GNOME's quick settings menu. GNOME's original is one click away ("Classic", or [[Shift+Super+S]]).
  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tiles: click the round icon to toggle, click the rest to see networks or devices. Right-click or long-press a tile for its details.
  The pencil button edits which tiles are shown. *Off:* `gnome-extensions disable bapirlo-control-centre@bapirlo-os`.
- **Dynamic Island.** The clock capsule shows volume, brightness, media, notifications, battery and screenshots. With a fullscreen app on the main screen it steps aside,
  and normal banners appear top-right instead. *Off:* `gnome-extensions disable bapirlo-island@bapirlo-os`.
- **Dock.** The dock hides when a window touches it and magnifies icons, and clicking an open app focuses it instead of opening a new window. *Off:* disable `dash2dock-lite@icedman.github.com`.
- **Launchpad.** [[Super+G]] opens it. It has search, A→Z sorting, folders, and [[Esc]] closes it. It lives in Bapirlo Desk:
  `gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.bapirlo-desk launchpad-toggle "[]"` removes the shortcut.
- **Desktop widgets and login briefing** (Bapirlo Desk). Calendar, Up next and System only show on an empty desktop. The briefing appears once after login.
  *Off:* Bapirlo Desk settings, or `gnome-extensions disable bapirlo-desk@bapirlo-os` (this also turns off Launchpad, PiP and privacy dots).
- **Privacy dots.** A red dot means the microphone is on, green means the camera, blue means screen sharing. They sit in the system capsule. Part of Bapirlo Desk.
- **Session restore.** After login, the apps you had open come back on their workspaces. *Off:* disable `bapirlo-session@bapirlo-os` and `SmartAutoMoveNG@lauinger-clan.de`.

### Power, performance & games

- **Power modes (bapirlo-perfd).** On mains power it picks Performance (MSI Turbo); on battery it picks Power Saver (Eco + silent fans).
  The battery stops charging at **80%** to protect it. Set in `/etc/bapirlo/perfd.conf`: `CHARGE_LIMIT=100` charges fully (then `sudo systemctl restart bapirlo-perfd`). *Off:* `sudo systemctl disable --now bapirlo-perfd`.
  Use the Control Centre's power tile to pick a mode by hand until the next plug/unplug.
- **Game Mode.** A fullscreen game, or OBS going live, turns on Do Not Disturb, holds Performance and starts instant replay. *Off:* disable `bapirlo-game@bapirlo-os`.
- **Instant replay.** GPU Screen Recorder keeps the last 30 s in memory on the Intel GPU, and nothing touches the disk until you press [[Super+Alt+G]].
- **Gaming / Quiet modes.** Switches in Bapirlo Welcome, or `bapirlo-mode gaming|quiet|dnd on|off`.

### Phone, sharing & remote

- **LocalSend.** Opening the app opens port 53317, for home networks only, and quitting closes it again.
- **AirPlay.** UxPlay runs only while the toggle is on, asks for a code the first time, and switches off after 15 minutes with nobody connected. Settings: `~/.config/bapirlo/airplay.conf` (IDLE_MIN, SIZE, FPS, HOTSPOT).
- **RustDesk.** Off by default. When it's on, it connects out to RustDesk's servers, so no ports are opened, and it uses a permanent password saved in your keyring.
  The ID and password are available with `bapirlo-remote id` and `bapirlo-remote password`. It disconnects after 30 minutes idle and works only while you are logged in.
- **iPhone (GSConnect).** Run `bapirlo-iphone setup` once after pairing. The phone app must be open to talk to the laptop.
- **iCloud Photos.** Off until you run `bapirlo-icloud setup`, then it syncs every 6 hours. *Off:* `bapirlo-icloud off`.

### Files & privacy

- **Vault.** An encrypted folder (gocryptfs). Unlock it with [[Super+Alt+V]] and your Vault password. It locks after 15 minutes idle, on screen lock, before suspend and at logout.
  **Without the password or the recovery key it can't be opened, by anyone.**
- **Downloads tidy.** Runs once a day and moves loose files into folders. Installers older than 30 days go to the Bin, never deleted.
  *Off:* `systemctl --user disable --now bapirlo-tidy.timer`.
- **Firewall.** Blocks everything coming in. Only phone sharing, Steam LAN and mDNS are allowed, and only from home networks. *Check:* `sudo ufw status`.

### Keeping it healthy

- **Snapshot before every update.** A pacman hook takes a Timeshift snapshot once per update run and keeps the newest **3**.
  It is skipped when less than 15 GB is free, so the update has room. Timeshift also keeps 2 weekly snapshots.
  *Skip once:* `sudo touch /run/bapirlo-nosnap`. *Off:* `sudo rm /etc/pacman.d/hooks/00-bapirlo-timeshift.hook`.
- **Bapirlo Doctor.** Runs after every system update and 90 s after each login, and only notifies you when something is wrong. For example, a GNOME update an extension doesn't
  support yet gets switched off at your next login. *Off:* `systemctl --user disable --now bapirlo-doctor.path bapirlo-doctor.timer`.
- **Spotify theme auto-reapply.** When Spotify updates itself, `bapirlo-spicetify.path` puts the theme back. *Off:* `systemctl --user disable --now bapirlo-spicetify.path`,
  then `bapirlo-spicetify off` for the stock look.
- **Monthly cleanup.** Clears the package cache (keeps 2 versions), removes orphans and trims old logs, then tells you what it freed. *Off:* `sudo systemctl disable --now bapirlo-cleanup.timer`.
- **Extension updates.** Extensions from extensions.gnome.org update through the Extension Manager app. Bapirlo's own extensions come from `~/bapirlo-os`.

## d) Windows

**Your Windows files.** Open Files and click **Windows** in the sidebar, or use the folder icon in the top bar → Windows. You can also go straight to
**Windows Desktop / Documents / Downloads / Pictures / Shared**, which are bookmarks in Files. Your Desktop, Documents and Pictures are the OneDrive ones.
The drive opens **read-only**: you can open and copy anything, but you can't change it. That is deliberate.

**Writing to Windows.** Run `bapirlo-windows rw`. It refuses unless Windows was fully shut down: Fast Startup off, no hibernation, no BitLocker, and the drive clean.
When you're done, run `bapirlo-windows ro`. `bapirlo-windows check` shows the safety flags at any time.

**Switching systems.**
- **To Windows:** Start menu → **Restart to Windows**, or the Windows button in the Control Centre footer. This boots Windows **once**.
  The boot order isn't changed, so the next normal restart comes back to Bapirlo OS. During start-up you can also use the boot menu: Limine, or **F11** for the MSI boot picker.
- **Back to Linux:** in Windows, just restart (not "Update and restart" into a loop). Bapirlo OS is the default.

**Shared files (both ways).** Use the **`C:\Shared`** folder:
- In Windows, it's `C:\Shared`.
- In Linux, it's Files → **Windows Shared**.
- Windows → Linux: save into `C:\Shared` in Windows, and it's readable here immediately.
- Linux → Windows: run `bapirlo-windows rw`, copy into Windows Shared, then run `bapirlo-windows ro`.
- Windows can't read Linux drives. To go the other way, put files in Shared, or use OneDrive, Google Drive or LocalSend.

**Clock.** Linux keeps the hardware clock in UTC. Windows keeps local time, which makes the clock jump an hour after switching.
**Fix once, in Windows:** double-click `C:\Shared\Fix clock for Linux (double-click).reg`, say Yes, then restart Windows.

**Bluetooth (AirPods etc.).** A device paired on both systems has two different keys, so the other system "forgets" it. `sudo bapirlo-bt-sync`
compares the keys, and `sudo bapirlo-bt-sync --apply` copies Windows' keys to Linux so they work in both without re-pairing.
**Pair in Linux first, then in Windows, then run `--apply` in Linux.** Re-run it whenever you re-pair in Windows.

**Never do this:**
- **Never write to the Windows drive if Fast Startup or hibernation is on.** Windows keeps the drive "half-open", and writing can corrupt it.
  `bapirlo-windows rw` checks this for you. In Windows, Control Panel → Power Options → Choose what the power buttons do → untick **Turn on fast startup**.
  It's off at the moment.
- **Never use "Disks" or any partition tool on the NVMe drive.** Windows, its recovery partitions, the EFI partition and Linux all share it.
- **Never turn on BitLocker / Device Encryption in Windows** without telling Linux. The drive just disappears from Files, and Windows may ask for a recovery key after Linux boots.
  Save the key in your Microsoft account first.
- Don't let Windows Update "repair the boot". If Linux stops appearing, pick Limine or CachyOS in the F11 boot picker. Your boot entries are still there.
- Don't delete the old `vmlinuz-*`, `initramfs-*` and `intel-ucode.img` files in `C:\` from Linux while Windows is running. They're stale copies and harmless; delete them from Windows if you like.

## e) Troubleshooting

**First, always:** run **Bapirlo Doctor** (Start menu, or `bapirlo-doctor` in a terminal or TTY). It lists what is broken and changes nothing.

### The desktop is frozen
1. Wait 10 seconds. Then press [[Esc]] and [[Super]]. A stuck menu or popup is the usual cause, and Esc closes it.
2. Press [[Super+Escape]]; this gives the shortcuts back from an app.
3. Still frozen? Press [[Ctrl+Alt+F3]] for a text login (TTY). Log in with your username and password, then:
   ```
   bapirlo-doctor                         # what's wrong
   export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/$(id -u)/bus
   gsettings set org.gnome.shell disable-user-extensions true    # all extensions off (live)
   ```
   Press [[Ctrl+Alt+F8]] to go back to your desktop. If it unfroze, an extension was the cause. Turn them back on one by one in the Extensions app,
   and finally turn the main switch back on with `gsettings set org.gnome.shell disable-user-extensions false`.
4. Still nothing: from the TTY run `sudo systemctl restart lightdm`. Unsaved work in open apps is lost.
5. Totally stuck, no TTY: hold the power button for 10 s.

### An extension disappeared or is "disabled" after an update
GNOME updates switch off any extension that doesn't list the new version. Bapirlo Doctor notifies you after the update.
- **Others' extensions** (Vitals, ArcMenu…): open **Extension Manager → Updates**. Usually a new version arrives within days.
- **Bapirlo's own extensions** (`bapirlo-*`): the code is in `~/bapirlo-os`. Ask Claude to add the new version and test it, or as a quick fix add the
  number to `"shell-version"` in the extension's `metadata.json` and log out and in.
- **Never** turn on "disable version validation" permanently. A truly incompatible extension can crash the shell at login. If that happens, use the TTY steps above.

### The login screen fails (black screen, loops, or won't accept the password)
1. [[Ctrl+Alt+F3]], log in, run `sudo bapirlo-greeter-revert`. This switches back to the plain LightDM login (slick-greeter), and then `sudo systemctl restart lightdm`.
2. Password refused everywhere? Caps Lock (the top bar shows its icon), keyboard layout (UK), or a broken keyring. In the TTY, `passwd` changes it.
3. Logs: `sudo journalctl -b -u lightdm` and `/var/log/lightdm/`.
4. Bring the Bapirlo login screen back later with `sudo bash ~/bapirlo-os/500-round5-greeter.sh switch`.

### No Wi-Fi
1. Control Centre → Wi-Fi tile: is it on? Is Aeroplane mode off? A Fn key may have switched the radio off.
2. In a terminal:
   ```
   nmcli radio wifi on
   rfkill unblock all
   nmcli device wifi list            # do you see networks?
   sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
   ```
3. **eduroam:** forget and re-add it with your full uni email and password (Settings → Wi-Fi), with the security set to "PEAP / MSCHAPv2" and "No CA certificate is required" if the uni guide says so.
4. After a kernel update without a reboot, Wi-Fi, USB or Bluetooth can stop working (the old kernel's drivers were removed). **Reboot.** Bapirlo now keeps
   the running kernel's modules until the next reboot, so this should not happen again.
5. Phone hotspot or a USB-C Ethernet adapter gets you online to fix things.

### Boot problems
- **Stuck on the Plymouth splash:** press [[Esc]] to see the boot messages. Wait a minute, because a disk check can be running. Still stuck? Try [[Ctrl+Alt+F3]].
- **Pick another kernel or the Windows entry:** press [[F11]] at the MSI logo for the firmware boot picker, then choose **Limine**. In Limine, pick the CachyOS entry.
  GRUB itself is hidden (timeout 0); tap [[Esc]] while it starts to see its menu, where **linux-cachyos** (non-LTS) is the fallback kernel.
- **"Kernel panic" or "unable to mount root":** boot the other kernel (above). If both fail, restore a snapshot (below).
- **Broke after an update:** restore the automatic "Before update" snapshot. From the desktop, open Timeshift → select it → Restore.
  If the desktop doesn't start, use the TTY: `sudo timeshift --list`, then `sudo timeshift --restore --snapshot '<name>' --skip-grub`.

### Restore a Timeshift snapshot from the CachyOS USB (when nothing boots)
1. Plug in the CachyOS USB. At the MSI logo press [[F11]] and pick the USB (UEFI). Boot the live desktop.
2. Connect to Wi-Fi, open a terminal and run `sudo pacman -Sy --needed timeshift` (skip if Timeshift is already on the stick).
3. Run `sudo timeshift --list --snapshot-device /dev/nvme0n1p6` to see your snapshots ("Before update …", "Bapirlo OS final", weekly…).
4. Restore, choosing the snapshot by name:
   ```
   sudo timeshift --restore --snapshot-device /dev/nvme0n1p6 --target-device /dev/nvme0n1p6 \
                  --snapshot '2026-10-12_18-00-00' --skip-grub
   ```
   `--skip-grub` leaves the boot loader exactly as it is, which is what you want, because the boot setup (Limine/GRUB) is fine and separate.
   Or use the Timeshift app on the live desktop: Settings → Location = the 150 GB Linux partition → pick the snapshot → Restore → **don't reinstall the bootloader**.
5. Remove the USB and reboot.
   - **Never pick nvme0n1p1 (EFI) or p3 (Windows)** anywhere in this process. The Linux partition is **nvme0n1p6**, ext4, 150 GB.
   - Home folder files are included only as hidden settings. Your documents aren't in snapshots, so back those up separately (OneDrive or Google Drive).

### Other quick fixes
| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Sound gone | Control Centre → Sound → pick the output; `systemctl --user restart pipewire wireplumber` |
| AirPods won't connect | Put them in the case, then hold the button until it flashes white. Bluetooth → remove → pair again, then `sudo bapirlo-bt-sync --apply` if they're also paired in Windows |
| Screen freezes ~2 s when opening Settings or other apps | The NVIDIA GPU waking up (known). Bapirlo's own buttons avoid it; it's harmless |
| Spotify lost its theme | `bapirlo-spicetify apply` |
| Disk almost full | Control Centre → Storage → Clean up · Disk Usage Analyzer · `sudo timeshift --list` and delete old snapshots |
| Windows drive won't open | It's in use by Windows hibernation or Fast Startup. Shut down Windows fully (Shift + Shut down), or run `bapirlo-windows check` |
| The bar or Island looks wrong after an update | Log out and in. Then Bapirlo Doctor |
| Undo any one Bapirlo change | `bash ~/bapirlo-os/<script>.sh restore` (see `~/theme-backups/LATEST-*`) |
| Undo everything since the final snapshot | Timeshift → **Bapirlo OS final** → Restore |
