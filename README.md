## Features

**One look, everywhere.** A single palette (`tools/palette.py`: ink `#0E0A0D`, crimson `#E11D2E`, ember `#FF4655`,
sakura `#F08AA4`, paper `#F2E9EC`) themes GRUB, Plymouth, the login screen, GNOME Shell, GTK3/GTK4/libadwaita,
Qt (Kvantum), the terminal, Spotify, Discord and Chrome.

| Area | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Boot & login** | GRUB theme, Plymouth "awakening" splash per monitor (*See you soon* / *Be right back* on shutdown and reboot), an animated web-greeter login that is also the lock screen |
| **Top bar** | Capsule layout: Kuro logo with a Mac-style menu, workspace numbers, quick launch, power-mode chip, app name, a **Dynamic Island** clock, then media, weather, CPU, places, drives, tray and Control Centre. It hides over fullscreen apps and comes back from the top edge |
| **Control Centre** | Mac-style tiles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth (with device lists), power mode, Do Not Disturb, Night Light, Caffeine, screen recording, Dark Style, sound, brightness, AirPlay, remote access, captions, Vault, battery, storage, now playing, and **Restart to Windows** |
| **Theme Studio** | Re-theme everything from a wallpaper (matugen palette in the Kuro shape, WCAG AA-checked), with a live preview, a cross-fade instead of a logout, saved presets and an exact *Original* restore. Optional boot splash. `studio/` |
| **Dynamic Island** | The clock capsule grows to show volume and brightness, media, notifications, battery and screenshots |
| **Launchpad & desk** | Full-screen app grid on Super+G, desktop widgets (calendar, *up next*, system), a login briefing, picture-in-picture kept on top, and privacy dots for the mic, camera and screen sharing |
| **Gaming** | A fullscreen game turns on DND, holds the Performance profile and starts a 30 s instant-replay buffer on the iGPU encoder. MangoHud and an OBS hook are included |
| **Laptop (MSI)** | `msi-ec` + `bapirlo-perfd`: Turbo on AC, Eco + silent fans on battery, 80 % charge limit |
| **iPhone & Windows** | LocalSend (AirDrop-style), an AirPlay receiver, KDE Connect, an iCloud web app, AirPods battery (LibrePods), the Windows drive in Files (read-only by default, with a safety check), a shared folder, Bluetooth key sync, and one-shot *Restart to Windows* (EFI BootNext) |
| **Productivity** | Kuro Writer (Claude rewrite + offline LanguageTool), Super+A Claude Code terminal, an encrypted Vault, a daily Downloads tidy, clipboard history, emoji picker, Satty screenshots |
| **Staying healthy** | A Timeshift snapshot before every update (keeps 3). **Kuro Doctor** runs after every update and login, and tells you when an extension no longer supports the new GNOME. Spotify's theme is re-applied after Spotify updates. A monthly cleanup runs too |
| **Docs** | A full plain-English manual in a themed **Kuro OS Guide** app ([MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md)) and a one-page [emergency sheet](EMERGENCY.md) ([PDF](EMERGENCY.pdf)) |

Everything is a plain script. Each one **backs up before it changes anything** (into `~/theme-backups`) and has its own `restore`.

<sub>Screenshots use a neutral wallpaper. The real theme is generated from whatever picture you give the installer.</sub>

## Install (fresh CachyOS + GNOME)

Requirements: CachyOS with the GNOME desktop (GNOME 50 or 51), your normal user with sudo, internet, and about 6 GB free.
The theme is built around **your own wallpaper**. The original art is third-party and is not in this repo.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git
git clone https://github.com/Bapirlo07/kuro-os.git ~/bapirlo-os
cd ~/bapirlo-os
./install.sh --dry-run --wallpaper ~/Pictures/your-art.jpg        # see every step first
./install.sh --wallpaper ~/Pictures/your-art.jpg --city "London" --lat 51.51 --lon -0.13
# optional: theme GRUB, Plymouth and the login screen too (read 50-boot-v2.sh first — machine-specific)
./install.sh --wallpaper ~/Pictures/your-art.jpg --boot
```

The installer:
- takes a Timeshift snapshot **"Before Kuro OS"** first;
- shows every package and asks before installing it (AUR packages go through `paru`, which shows each PKGBUILD);
- never touches partitions, `/etc/fstab`, the EFI partition or your boot loader configuration (unless you pass `--boot`, which themes GRUB).

Log out and back in at the end, then open **Kuro OS Guide** and run **Kuro Doctor**.

**Undo:** every script has `bash <script>.sh restore`, or restore the "Before Kuro OS" snapshot in Timeshift.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `NN-*.sh` | One script per step, in the order they were made (`install.sh` runs them in order) |
| `bar/` `control-centre/` `dynamic-island/` `media-widget/` `desk/` `game/` `ai/` `sounds/` `session/` | Kuro's own GNOME Shell extensions (most have a headless test harness in `test/`) |
| `apps/` | Welcome, About, **Guide**, app themes (Spicetify, Vesktop, Chrome, VS Code, Starship, cava) |
| `writer/` | Kuro Writer (GTK4) |
| `bin/` | The `bapirlo-*` commands (`bapirlo-doctor`, `bapirlo-mode`, `bapirlo-vault`, `bapirlo-restart-windows` …) |
| `windows/` | Dual-boot helpers (`bapirlo-windows`, `bapirlo-bt-sync`) |
| `greeter/` | The web-greeter login / lock screen theme |
| `config/settings.dconf` | Exported GNOME + extension settings, with personal data removed (`tools/export-settings.py`) |
| `round2/` `round3/` `round7/` `final/` | Units, polkit rules, icons and configs those rounds install |
| `tools/` | Palette, art builders, icon generators, the settings exporter |
| `MANUAL.md` · `EMERGENCY.md` | The manual and the emergency sheet |
